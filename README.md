# Portfolio.github.io

<!-- overall the page is used meant to allow people to see me and some of the photos i have taken --> 

<!-- Eventually I plan to push more of my personal desings that I have created and add more pages -->

<!-- Overall much of what I have done here is pulled code from w3schools, bootstrap, and MDB and edited things in the css -->

<!-- There is a style sheet for each of the pages to pull from, there is also a folder alone for the background and one for the images palced in my portfolio page -->
